Hiya! Three Finger Click is a website that simplifies tech jargon for beginners.

If you want to submit an article just send me a pull request. You can either send it in plain text and I'll set it up myself or use the template in the posts folder. Just paste the text into the <p> tag and change the title. Easy.

If you do want to contribute please remember that this is a website for absolute beginners. It can be really hard to keep an article about technology jargon free so don't be offended if I dumb it down a bit before I post it. I promise to show you a revised version before it goes live and you will be attributed.

Otherwise, I hope you find this site helpful :-)
