        <h1>Client-Side/Server-Side Scripting</h1>
        <p>A client-side script is a program that runs on the user's machine. The computer runs the code in the web browser and generates everything you see on your screen. The opposite of this is server-side scripting where a seperate server (that could be anywhere in the world) runs the code and sends the end product to the user's computer.</p>
        <p>For this next bit let's pretend you're a horrible cretin who has chosen Internet Explorer as your browser of choice. <br><br>Client-side - You open a website. The code includes the sum 1+1. Internet Explorer calculates the sum and delivers the number 2 to your screen.<br><br>Server-side - You open a website. The code includes the sum 1+1. Internet Explorer sends a message to the server telling it to run the code. The server calculates the sum and delivers the result to back to Internet Explorer who has no idea there ever was a sum, it's just relieved to have a nice number 2.</p>
    <p>Both options have pros and cons. JavaScript is the only client-side language on the web and it is good for programmers because the code is available to view and manipulate using tools like 'Inspect Element' in Chrome (right click on a webpage to see what I mean). This is NOT good for companies who deal with sensitive information or money, because as much as we would all love to open up the inspector and add a few 0's to the end of our bank balance, life is not an episode of Hustle.</p>
    <p>Most successful websites use a mix of the two, which is good because server-side has absolutely no idea where the mouse is at any given moment and this could make things pretty tricky for the user if the two didn't collaborate. Luckily there are ways to deal with this, such as AJAX, but that is a whole other article in itself.</p>
