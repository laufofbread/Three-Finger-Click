    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>A lot of people I know spent their high school IT lessons making PowerPoint presentations about the benefits of Excel and typing Google into the Yahoo search engine (if you remember the Hampster Dance, you're probably one of the people I'm talking about). Currently, there is a whole generation of young adults who tread a fine line when it comes to computer literacy and they are turning to online resources like Codecademy, Lynda.com and Team Treehouse to get the basic programming skills they missed out on in school. 

It's pretty amazing to be able to learn a real-world skill like programming from the internet, but once you've finished with the tutorials and decided to embark on a project of your own a big leap in difficulty emerges, often in the form of tech jargon. It's easy for a professional to forget that we weren't all born knowing the difference between HTML and XML, just as it's easy for a beginner to be put off by a wiki article that reads like an extract from Finnegans Wake.

The aim of this site is to help those with a general interest in programming overcome the knowledge hurdle by setting out commonly used terminology in the most basic way possible. I'm a beginner myself so I'll be learning as I go along, but the project will be available on GitHub and I welcome anyone who wants to contribute an article. Alternatively if you would like to suggest a piece of vernacular to demystifying, or you just want to tell me how awesome I am, you can contact me on Twitter.
